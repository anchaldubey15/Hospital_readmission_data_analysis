This project aims to predict the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days for diabetic patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of patient records, we develop and evaluate classification models to identify individuals at high risk of early readmission. This information can be valuable for healthcare providers to implement targeted interventions and improve patient care, potentially reducing readmission rates and associated costs.

The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training (with a focus on Random Forest and XGBoost), and comprehensive model evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** (recommended) - You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip** (Python package installer) - Usually included with Python installations.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git` with the actual URL of your repository.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS and Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the dependencies. A basic one would look like this):
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn
    xgboost
    scipy
    imblearn
    ```

## Data

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project contains records of diabetic patients and their hospital encounters. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhtayal/diabetic-patients-readmission-prediction]

### Data Description

The dataset includes various features related to patient demographics, medical conditions, medications, and hospital visits. Key features include:

- [List a few important features and briefly describe them. For example:]
    - `race`: Patient's race.
    - `gender`: Patient's gender.
    - `age`: Patient's age group.
    - `admission_type_id`: Type of hospital admission.
    - `discharge_disposition_id`: Status of patient at discharge.
    - `diag_1`, `diag_2`, `diag_3`: Primary, secondary, and tertiary diagnoses.
    - `medications`: Information about prescribed medications.
    - `A1Cresult`: Result of A1C test.
    - `max_glu_serum`: Maximum glucose serum test result.
    - `readmitted`: The target variable indicating if the patient was readmitted within 30 days (`<30`), after 30 days (`>30`), or not readmitted (`NO`). This was transformed into a binary target (1 for `<30`, 0 for `>30` or `NO`).

## Project Structure

The project start with and Excel file where the data has been imported and then cleaned--> interpreted --> analysed --> some data visualization--> summary table.
After for the purpose of EDA python has been used where we performed some common steps as preprocessing--> standardization/normalization --> feature eng .
along with these files project contains a detailed info inform of report pdf.

## Future improvedment
Further models needs to be throughly analysed for teh more better accuracy, also some deep concept of ML required for further betterment
but as a beginner IG this is good way to start ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.....
